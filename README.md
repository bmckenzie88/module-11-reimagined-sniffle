## Usage

![The web page displaying the note taker application, rendering the stored notes on one side while taking in new note information on the other](./Assets/note-taker-screenshot.png)
This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. Once the user has entered a new title and text for the note, a save button will appear in the upper right corner of the app, allowing them to save the note to a JSON file that will persistently load to the notes page even after page refresh and server restart.

You can view the deployed web app [here](https://note-taker-reimagined-sniffle.herokuapp.com/).
